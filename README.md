# Cachify

Turn your Spotify playlist into a cache.

### Who is this for?

For people, who like me, have playlists with 100s of tracks in them... and growing!

Instead of your playlists growing out of control you can now set the max number of tracks in a playlist so as you add new tracks, older tracks will be removed.

### Plans

Currently the only cache implemented is FIFO (First In First Out).

The hope is Spotify will eventually add a play count or last played to tracks in a playlist so a LRU (Least Recently Used) or LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache can be implemented.
